/*
 * 1.     In the mysql-java project in Eclipse, create a file named "projects-schema.sql" in the src/main/resources directory.

2.     Add DROP TABLE statements at the top of the file to drop the tables in the correct order. There can be some variation but the tables with dependencies (foreign key references to other tables) must be dropped first. The tables should only be dropped if they exist.

3.     Write the CREATE TABLE statements in the inverse of the order that they were dropped. Include the following:

a.     Auto-increment the primary key columns.

b.     Primary key statements.

c.      Foreign key statements with appropriate ON DELETE CASCADE.

4.     Remember to close each DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statement with a semicolon.

5.     Paste the SQL into the DBeaver SQL editor. Run all DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements. Include your created tables as shown in DBeaver's connection explorer (leftmost panel) in your video
